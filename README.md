## Overview
This project aims to create a robust house price prediction system using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes Python for data processing and modeling, Jupyter notebooks for analysis, PyCharm and VS Code for development, and HTML/CSS/JS for building a real user interface. Additionally, a backend API is implemented to handle the model predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyCharm 
- Visual Studio Code (VS code)
- HTML/CSS/JS (for developing the front-end )
- Libraries and frameworks ( Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Flask web framework )
- Pickle and Joblib ( Model serialization )
